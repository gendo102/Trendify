Submission #1:
Both of us worked together to authenticate a user using the client ID and client secret.
Also implemented the ability to display an artist's popular tracks and related artists.

Submission #2:
We plan to work on it together for the next submission.
I will focus on the implementation for allowing a user to log-in using their username and displaying the user's
listening trends or playlists.

Submission #3:
For this submission I focused on implementing the user authorization so users can log
into their Spotify account. Then the program displays their name and how many followers
they have. The program also allows the user to display their favorite/saved songs on
Spotify and get a list of their playlists.
