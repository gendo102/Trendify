Submission #1:
Both of us worked together to authenticate a user using the client ID and client secret.
Also implemented the ability to display an artist's popular tracks and related artists.

Submission #2:
We plan to work on it together for the next submission.
I will focus on the implementation for allowing a user to log-in using their username and
displaying the user's listening trends or playlists.

Submission #3:
For this submission I focused on implementing the user authorization so users can log
into their Spotify account. Then the program displays their name and how many followers
they have. The program also allows the user to display their favorite/saved songs on
Spotify and get a list of their playlists.

Final Submission:
For the final submission I helped add the option to display a user's recently played artists
within different ranges of time. I also added the Dockerfile and requirements.txt so that it is
more efficient to build and run the program with a docker container that has spotipy already installed.
