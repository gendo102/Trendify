Submission #1:
Both of us worked together to authenticate a user using the client ID. We also implemented the ability to display a artist’s popular tracks and related artists.

For Submission #2:
We plan to work on it together for the next submission but I will focus on providing recommendations based on the user’s listening information and other things like their top played songs.

For Submission #3:
We worked together again on implementing different features. I specifically worked on making the menu of options and listing the user's playlists. For the final submission I will focus on being able to accept user data and display different charts and other finishing touches.
